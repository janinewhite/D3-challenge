# D3-challenge

The challenge is to create a scatterplot using D3 and the given data.  In addition to meeting the challenge of reading the data and creating the scatterplot with tooltips, I added dropdown lists to select the fields to display in the scatterplot.  THe data was provided without much background, so, it's not very meaningful, but it does show that I can implement a scatterplot, dropdown lists and buttons using D3.
